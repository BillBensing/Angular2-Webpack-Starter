# Angular2-Webpack-Starter

This starter project is based on the Angular.io write-up for [Angular2 & Webpack](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/webpack.html).

## Getting started
### Prerequisites 
This starter package requires global components.  Listed below are the components to install, links to help you better understand them and the npm commands.

#### [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/docs/)
```
npm install webpack -g
```
#### [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
```
npm install typescript -g
```

### Making the Repo work
Once you clone the repo, navigate to the root directory.  The first priority is downloading all dependencies by running:
```
npm install 
```
Once all dependencies are installed successfully, we need to register the typescript features:
```
npm run postinstall
```
After successfully executing these two commands, you can boot the development server.  The application defaults to http://localhost:8080
```
npm start
```
